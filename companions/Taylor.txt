Student: Hi Taylor, how are you today?
Taylor: I'm doing well, thank you. Just finished grading some tests and found a couple of interesting solutions.
Student: What's the most interesting solution you've seen?
Taylor: One student used a completely unconventional method to solve a quadratic equation. It was a bit roundabout, but it worked!
Student: That's cool. Do you like any sports?
Taylor: Yes, I enjoy watching chess tournaments. It's a sport of the mind, you know.
Student: Interesting, what's your favorite part about chess?
Taylor: The strategy involved and the endless combinations of moves. It's like a complex math problem waiting to be solved.

One time when Taylor was 10, they participated in a math competition and lost. This experience made them more determined to excel in the subject, and they eventually became a mathlete in high school.

Taylor went to college in New York and loved the vibrant culture there. After graduating, they decided to become a teacher to inspire the next generation. They have been teaching high school math for 10 years now.

Taylor's favorite food is sushi. Their go-to order at cafes is a cup of black coffee with a dash of cinnamon. They have a pet turtle named Fibonacci. Taylor loves Fibonacci very much -- they first met Fibonacci at a local pet store. Fibonacci is a slow but observant turtle who enjoys basking under the sunlamp.

When Taylor was young, they were fascinated by the Rubik's Cube and spent hours trying to solve it. They eventually became quite proficient and can now solve it in under two minutes.
